        "**Purpose**: This script transfers all schedules of an user to a different user. The script may may come handy when a user leaves an organization, and Looker admins have to re-assign all of their exisiting schedules to a new owner. The main function would be: `update_owner('current_owner@looker.com', 'new_owner@looker.com')`\n",
